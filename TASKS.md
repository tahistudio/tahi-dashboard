## Phase I Slice 1 — Ideation engine (2026-05-27)

- [x] PI-S1.1 — [FE/BE] **Ideation cron + signals + Ideas tab.** Settings → Content engine signals section (GA4 auto-detect, Matomo url/token, SE Ranking key, cron toggle, weekly target). New routes: `POST /api/admin/integrations/google/discover-ga4`, `POST /api/admin/cron/ideation` (Sonnet w/ structured JSON output, gracefully skips missing signals, master toggle defaults off, ?force=1 bypass), `POST /api/admin/content/clusters/seed` (idempotent 8 default clusters), `GET /api/admin/content/clusters`, `GET /api/admin/content/ideas` (status + week filters with isoWeekLabel helper), `PATCH /api/admin/content/ideas/[id]` (approve/reject/notes). `/content-studio` Ideas tab: cluster filter chips, card grid with approve/reject/details, SlideOver detail drawer with 2-3 targeted questions (skipped for definition + comparison posts). Honours `?tab=ideas` from notifications. Cron registered in `/api/admin/crons`. type-check + lint zero errors. — [FE/BE] 2026-05-27

## Phase I Slice 2 — Drafting pipeline (2026-05-27)

- [x] PI-S2.1 — [BE] **Multi-agent drafting pipeline + content_drafts schema + Drafts tab.** Migration 0060 adds `content_drafts` (one row per drafting run, FK cascade to content_ideas). `lib/blog-researcher.ts` runs pre-write Sonnet research with web_search (max_uses=5). `lib/link-validator.ts` strict 200-validates citation URLs (HEAD with GET fallback, 10s timeout, batches of 8, drops tahi.studio). `lib/blog-writer.ts` runs the chain: Brand Voice Writer (Sonnet, all 6 ephemeral context docs) → Sales + Readability reviewers in parallel → Editor-in-Chief (Opus 4.7) merges + scores out of 100 with breakdown { aeo, voice, readability, seo, linksOk }. Markdown→HTML deterministic mini-renderer (Workers bundle-budget friendly). `lib/ai-context.ts` got `loadAiContextDocs` returning the 6 docs separately. New routes: `POST /api/admin/content/ideas/[id]/draft` (full orchestrator — research, validate links, write, schema-additions, hreflang, cover→R2, flip idea to drafted), `GET /api/admin/content/drafts` (status + counts), `GET/DELETE /api/admin/content/drafts/[id]`. `POST /api/admin/cron/draft-approved-ideas` picks up approved ideas hourly (disabled by default via `content.draftingEnabled`, capped 1-3 per tick). Cron registered. /content-studio Drafts tab: grouped sections (in-progress → ready → failed), progress stepper per card, score bar breakdown, soft 6s poll while in-flight, SlideOver detail with body preview, FAQs, takeaways, cover image, citations, reviewer notes (collapsed), JSON-LD schema (collapsed), Discard + Schedule (greyed for Slice 5) buttons. type-check + lint zero errors. — [BE] 2026-05-27

## Up next (QA / UIUX)

- [ ] PI-S1.QA — [QA] **Live smoke test of Slice 1.** Hit Settings → Content engine signals on prod, click Auto-detect GA4 (post-Google reauth with analytics.readonly scope), set ideationEnabled=true. Then `/content-studio?tab=ideas` → Run ideation now. Verify ideas land in the cluster grid, approve / reject / details drawer work, week label is correct. Confirm SlideOver footer Save Notes / Approve / Reject buttons all save.
- [ ] PI-S1.UIUX — [UIUX] **Spacing + colour review** of Ideas tab card grid + SlideOver. Confirm cluster pill colours read against dark mode + brand pill (Liam/Staci) palette aligns with rest of dashboard.
- [ ] PI-S2.MIGRATE — [BE/Ops] **Apply migration 0060 to prod D1.** `GET /api/admin/db/migrate?run=0060`. Creates `content_drafts` table + 2 indexes. Idempotent.
- [ ] PI-S2.QA — [QA] **Live smoke test of Slice 2 drafting pipeline.** After 0060 runs: approve an idea in /content-studio?tab=ideas, watch the Drafts tab transition through researching → drafting → reviewing → finalising → ready. Verify content score lands 0-100, score breakdown bars render, body preview shows valid HTML, FAQs populate, citations are all 200-status, cover image displays from R2, Discard returns the idea to Approved. Test failed-path by hitting an invalid Anthropic key.
- [ ] PI-S2.UIUX — [UIUX] **Drafts tab visual pass.** Confirm progress stepper, score bars, and SlideOver layout (especially body preview height + cover image responsiveness) at 375px + dark mode.

## Newly raised in this session (2026-05-21)

- [ ] T735 — [FE] **Voice note playback fix.** `app/(dashboard)/messages/messages-content.tsx:95` `VoiceNotePlayer` animates a progress bar instead of decoding the recorded blob. Recording (MediaRecorder) and R2 upload work; only the player UI is fake. Replace with `<audio>` element pointing at the R2 file URL from the message's voiceNote ref. Optional follow-up: wavesurfer.js for visualisation. — [FE]
- [ ] T736 — [QA] **Live Chrome verification of the pipeline polish backlog.** All 5 items (default owner, value model, optimistic drag, nudge signature, deletable activity) have shipped per code review on 2026-05-21 but have not been verified by the user on the deployed URL. Run a Chrome QA pass and report. — [QA]
- [ ] T737 — [QA] **Live R2 upload verification.** Code has graceful error reporting; confirm STORAGE binding is actually configured in Webflow Cloud by uploading a file end-to-end. If broken, the binding is in `wrangler.json`. — [QA]
- [ ] T738 — [QA] **Live settings page tab walk-through.** March QA flagged team / portal branding / modules toggles as broken. Code has no obvious stubs. Click every tab on prod and report what behaves vs what's broken. — [QA]

## Schema Additions (Phase 11)

Some columns from these are already in the schema — verify before writing the migration.

- [ ] S23 — [BE] Add `notificationPreferences` table: id (uuid pk), userId (text, unique), email/inApp/push toggles per event type, pushSubscription (text nullable JSON), createdAt, updatedAt. **Not yet in `db/schema.ts`.**
- [ ] S24 — [BE] Add `commentsLocked` (int default 0) column to requests table. **Note: `editedAt` and `deletedAt` on messages already exist in current schema; only `commentsLocked` needs adding.**
- [ ] S25 — [BE] Add `xero_category_overrides` table + `hourlyRateCurrency` and `salaryAnnual` columns on teamMembers. Plus `billingModel` (retainer | hourly | project | none), `retainerStartDate`, `retainerEndDate` on organisations for T668-T672.

## North-star phases (queued behind Phase 11)

See `memory/project_phase_roadmap.md` for the full list. Driven by `SPECS/north-star-integrated-flow.md`. Do not start until Phase 11 is closed.

## Trust-crossover targets (parallel to Phase 11)

Per `memory/project_trust_state_2026_05.md` — user currently daily-trusts pipeline + finance only. Each feature below gets a complete UX + bug audit + live QA pass before moving on. No rush; quality over speed.

1. Tasks — Decision #046 cleaned up the model; needs polish + add-flow QA
2. Requests — close any remaining privacy / file / voice-note gaps
3. Messages — T677–T681 above already cover comment lock + edit/delete
4. Time tracking — pair with T673–T676
5. Contracts / proposals / schedules / calculator — already premium; promote via pipeline integration
